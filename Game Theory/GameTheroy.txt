The Prisoner's Dilemma 
    is a famous example in game theory that shows why two rational individuals might not cooperate, 
    even if it seems that cooperation is in their best interest.

    Two prisoners are arrested. Each has two options:

    Cooperate (C) with the other and stay silent.

    Defect (D) and betray the other.

    Payout Matrix (Years in Jail):
                    Prisoner B: C	Prisoner B: D
    Prisoner A: C	A: 1, B: 1	    A: 3, B: 0
    Prisoner A: D	A: 0, B: 3	    A: 2, B: 2

    If both cooperate, they get 1 year each.

    If one defects, the defector goes free, and the other gets 3 years.

    If both defect, both get 2 years.


Strategy – Finder-Keeper Game

    Two players A and B play a game in which a certain number of coins are placed on the table.

    - Each player can pick at least 'a' and at most 'b' coins during their turn.
    - If fewer than 'a' coins are left, the player must pick all the remaining coins.

    1. Finder-Winner Game
    ---------------------
    > The player who picks the last coin wins.

    Strategy:
    - Reduce the opponent to a state with coins equal to:
    (a + b) × k
    - This is a losing state for the opponent.

    2. Keeper-Loser Game
    --------------------
    > The player who picks the last coin loses.

    Strategy:
    - Reduce the opponent to a state with coins equal to:
    (a + b) × k + x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ a
    - This is a losing state for the opponent.

    Examples
    ========

    Example 1:
    ----------
    Game type: Finder-Winner
    a = 2, b = 6, Total coins = 74
    Target losing state = 8 × k  = 72
    Initial move: A should pick 74 - 72 = 2 coins

    Example 2:
    ----------
    Game type: Keeper-Loser
    a = 3, b = 5, Total coins = 92
    Target losing state = 8 × k + x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ 3
    Try values:
    - 8×11 + 6 = 94 Awin
    - 8×11 + 4 = 92 Awin
    - 8×9  + 4 = 76 Awin
    - 8*8  + 2 = 66 Bwin
    Best match: 75
    Initial move: A should pick 92 - 75 = 17 coins

    Example 3:
    ----------
    Game type: Finder-Winner
    a = 1, b = 6, Total coins = 56
    Since 56 is a multiple of 7 (a + b), it's a losing state.
    => A will lose no matter what.

    Example 4:
    ----------
    Game type: Keeper-Loser
    a = 3, b = 6, Total coins = 126
    Target losing state: 9 × k + 0, 1 ≤ x ≤ 3
